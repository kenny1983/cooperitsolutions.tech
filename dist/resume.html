			<section>
				<p>I have an unequivocal passion for programming and I.T in general, but especially for creating
					modern, well-designed websites that <b>actually work.</b> In my honest opinion, there are far too many
					live websites that have seemingly been thrown together nonchalantly and unintuitively, with some
					features taking great effort to utilise, if they work at all!</p>
				<p>Given the time and permission, I would endeavour to fix them all, but failing that, I simply wish to
					work for clients that appreciate and strive for the same level of usability and design ingenuity.</p>
				<p>I believe my extensive background and skill set in the areas of desktop and web development
					speak for themselves and that I would be a great credit to any organisation, and even to a single-person client.</p>
